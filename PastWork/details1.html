            <h1 class="detailsH">Problem</h1>
            <p class="detailsP">In response to the initial lockdowns faced due to COVID-19 in 2020, this local Halifax brewery went quickly to work creating an e-commerce platform using Shopify. Due to a lack of a technical lead and many hands working on the website, it quickly became cluttered and disorganized.</p>

            <h1 class="detailsH">Solution</h1>
            <p class="detailsP">I was brought on to look through the website and make adjustments. I had a knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, which allowed me to navigate the code with more understanding than other staff.</p>
            
            <h1 class="detailsH">Outcome</h1>
            <p class="detailsP">Through communication with one of the managers and the e-commerce lead at the time, we were able to come up with a few specific areas of focus. The main area being the general layout of the store. Shopifyâ€™s templates were not robust enough to handle all the changes that had been made, and the product grid was all out of whack. I was able to undo a lot of the changes that had been made previously and instate some more robust styling rules to keep the grids in-line. 
                Additionally, I added new features for advertising and identification checks, and worked with a marketing team member to create a page for their brand and values to be displayed.
                </p>
            
            <h1 class="detailsH">Learning</h1>
            <p class="detailsP">I was able to familiarize myself with the inner workings of the Shopify platform, which I did not know anything about previously. Additionally, I was able to further develop communication and project management skills by having to set meetings and progress reports with members of different teams. </p>
